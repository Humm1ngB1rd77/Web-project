<section id="projectdesc">
    <p>
        A prime number checker program is a simple tool that helps determine whether a number entered by the user is prime or not.
        It works by evaluating the number's divisibility;
        a prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself.
        The program typically asks the user to input a number,
        then checks if it has any divisors other than 1 and the number itself,
        starting from 2 up to the number written by a user.
        If it finds any such divisors, the program will confirm that the number is not prime; otherwise,
        it will indicate that the number is prime.
        This program is useful for quickly verifying prime numbers,
        especially for beginners learning about number theory.

    <h2>Where the idea came from</h2>
    <p>
        The idea for this project came from a similar problem we were working on in college using JavaScript.
        I found the challenge of determining prime numbers interesting and wanted to explore how the same logic
        could be implemented in Python. Since I was already familiar with the basic concepts from our JavaScript
        exercises, I thought it would be a great opportunity to practice Python and see how the two languages
        compare in terms of syntax and problem-solving approaches. This project allowed me to apply what I had
        learned in a new context while strengthening my understanding of Python fundamentals.
        You can check out the project on my GitHub repository.

    <h3>What I Learned from My First Python Project</h3>
    <p>
        Working on this project has been an incredible journey of learning and growth.
        When I first started, I was a complete beginner in Python, though I had some prior programming experience in other languages.
        Initially, adapting to Python's syntax and structure felt challenging, but as I progressed,
        I found it to be intuitive and powerful. This project, which involved checking whether a number is prime,
        allowed me to explore fundamental programming concepts and apply them in a practical way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout the process, I learned how to handle user input, use loops effectively,
        and implement conditional statements to make logical decisions.
        Debugging was another key aspect of my learning, as I encountered various logical and syntactical
        errors that taught me how to think critically and solve problems efficiently.
        Writing clean and efficient code gradually became easier as I understood Python's built-in functions and best practices.
        Additionally, the process of repeatedly running and refining my code helped me develop patience and perseverance,
        which are crucial qualities for any programmer.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the most rewarding aspects of this project was seeing my code evolve
        from simple lines to a fully functional program that checks for prime numbers.
        Each step of the way, I built confidence in my programming abilities and gained
        valuable insights into how algorithms work. This experience has inspired me to
        take on more complex challenges and continue improving my skills in Python.

        I am excited to continue exploring Python and working on more projects that challenge
        me to grow as a programmer. This project has been a stepping stone,
        and I look forward to expanding my knowledge further.
