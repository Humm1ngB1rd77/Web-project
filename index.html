  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi! I'm a student of Information and Communication Technologies with a strong passion for web development and cybersecurity.
    Currently I am studying Electrical Engineering at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Ljubljana,
    and I have gained experience working with various programming languages, including Python, C, C++, and JavaScript.
    Although I’m still early in my career, I’m focused on building my skills in both software development and cybersecurity,
    with the goal of becoming a bug bounty hunter and penetration tester.
    I also have a keen interest in 3D printing and Arduino projects, where I enjoy combining creativity with technical problem-solving.
    I'm excited to continue learning and growing in these fields!

  <h2>About This Website</h2>
  <p>
    This website was created to showcase the projects I've built, whether by following tutorials or developing them independently.
    For a long time, I wanted to create my own "web diary," so I decided to bring this idea to life using HTML and CSS.
    The projects displayed here are some of the successful milestones in my journey, each representing a key learning experience.
    Writing about them not only helps me reflect on my progress but also deepens my understanding of the skills I've gained.
    Ultimately, this site serves as both a portfolio and a personal record of my growth as a developer.
